As a beginner, learning GITHUB seemed a task that required much knowledge
beforehand. I was also overwhelmed by the commands and the new terms, made me feel like maybe I shouldnt do this now. I dont like how it feels like a steep learning curve which brings out an inhibition within us. In fact I would say it isnt entirely GIT's issue, I has these preconcieved notions about working with it, probably one of the reasons why I stalled it all alo I must say learning GIT isnt that hard afterall, all you need is some patience and willingness to explore. What I didnt like about my approach was underestimating myself, you may have capabilities to do something but you will never know until you start. You need to start somewhere!! Self belief is something that I missed from the start of joining college(was kinda shattered from JEE ngl). Eventually tings will fall in place, all you need to do is give time and keep trying. Remembe ryou have nothing to lose. Cheers!!!
